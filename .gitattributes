# Git Attributes File
# --------------------
# This file provides instructions to Git on how to handle different file types
# to ensure consistency and prevent corruption.

# Auto-detect text files and normalize all line endings to LF (Unix-style).
# This is the recommended setting for cross-platform projects.
* text=auto

# Explicitly declare binary file types.
# The 'binary' attribute tells Git to treat these files as-is and to not
# perform any text processing (like line-ending normalization) on them.
# This is critical to prevent corruption of binary assets.
