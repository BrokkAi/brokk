Coding Style Guide

1. **Utilize Java 8 features**: The codebase leverages Java 8 features, such as lambda expressions (`x -> x + 1`) and method references (`System.out::println`).
1. **Prefer functional streams to manual loops**: Leverage streams for transforming collections, joining to Strings, etc.
1. **Favor Immutable Data Structures**: The codebase makes extensive use of immutable data structures, such as `List` and `Map`, to ensure thread-safety and eliminate the need for explicit synchronization.
1. **Provide Comprehensive Logging**: The codebase makes extensive use of the `LogManager` and `Logger` classes to log relevant information, including request/response details, errors, and other important events.
1. **Utilize Try-with-Resources**: The codebase makes use of the try-with-resources construct to ensure proper resource management and cleanup, as seen in the `Environment` class.
1. **Use `var`**: Prefer `var` for local variable declarations. Exception: numeric types, such as `int`, `float`, etc.
1. **Avoid StringBuilder**: prefer joins or String.format where possible
