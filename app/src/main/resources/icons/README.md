# Icons

Icons live in a single set under the `icons` directory. Colors are derived from theme JSON using the Brokk icon keys
(`Brokk.icon_primary`, `Brokk.icon_secondary`, `Brokk.icon_light`, `Brokk.icon_accent`,
`Brokk.icon_accent_light`). The base icon size is 24x24.

This icon pack is missing a suitable entry for "Pull Request" which is instead retrieved from the free
tier from [Streamline](https://www.streamlinehq.com/icons/download/git-pull-request--31052).
