# Overview

Brokk (the [Norse god of the forge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brokkr))
is the first code assistant that understands code semantically, not just
as chunks of text.  Brokk is designed to allow LLMs to work effectively
on large codebases that cannot be jammed entirely into working context.

There is a [Brokk Discord](https://discord.gg/QjhQDK8kAj) for questions and suggestions.

# Running Brokk

1. Sign up at [Brokk.ai](https://brokk.ai/)
1. Follow the instructions to install jbang and run Brokk

# Documentation

Brokk documentation is at https://brokk.ai/documentation/.

# Contributing

Brokk uses Gradle with Scala support. To build Brokk,
1. Ensure you have JDK 21 or newer  
2. Run Gradle commands directly: `./gradlew <command>`  
3. Available commands: `run`, `clean`, `test`, `build`, `shadowJar`, etc.  
4. (one-time) Install the Git hooks that keep the codebase formatted:  

   ```bash
   ./gradlew installGitHooks
   ```  

   The hook automatically runs `./gradlew spotlessApply` before every commit and aborts
   the commit if formatting problems are detected.  
   (The hooks are also installed automatically when you run `./gradlew build`.)

There are documents on specific aspects of the code in [development.md](https://github.com/BrokkAi/brokk/tree/master/app/src/main/development.md).
