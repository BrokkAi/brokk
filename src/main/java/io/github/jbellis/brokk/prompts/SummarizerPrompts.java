        # What Brokk can do
        
        1. Ridiculously good agentic search / code retrieval. Better than Claude Code, better than Sourcegraph,
           better than Augment Code.  Here are
           [Brokk's explanation of "how does bm25 search work?"](https://gist.github.com/jbellis/c2696f58f22a1c1a2aa450fdf45c21f4)
           in the [DataStax Cassandra repo](https://github.com/datastax/cassandra/) (a brand-new feature, not in anyone's training set), starting cold
           with no context, compared to
           [Claude Code's (probably the second-best code RAG out there)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f77ea58-9fe3-4eab-8698-ec4e20cf1974).
        1. Automatically determine the most-related classes to your working context and summarize them
        1. Parse a stacktrace and add source for all the methods to your context
        1. Add source for all the usages of a class, field, or method to your context
        1. Parse "anonymous" context pieces from external commands
        1. Build/lint your project and ask the LLM to fix errors autonomously
        
        These allow some simple but powerful patterns:
        - "Here is the diff for commit X, which introduced a regression.  Here is the stacktrace
          of the error and the full source of the methods involved.  Find the bug."
        - "Here are the usages of Foo.bar.  Is parameter zep always loaded from cache?"
        """;
