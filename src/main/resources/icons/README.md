Many of the icons under the `dark` and `light` directories are from the [Google Material Icons](https://fonts.google.com/icons)
pack. The primary color for the `dark` icons is `#e3e3e3` and for `light` is `#000000`. Their size is 24.

This icon pack is missing a suitable entry for "Pull Request" which is instead retrieved from the free
