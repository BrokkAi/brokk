Welcome to Brokk!

Brokk is code intelligence for AI.

Check out the README at https://github.com/jbellis/brokk, but
here's the short version:

Use the `Edit Files` button to add files that you want Brokk to edit. You can
use `Read Files` to add files that are related to your problem but you don't
want edited; you can also summarize a file (or a class).

You can paste text and images; stacktraces will be automatically parsed
and method sources extracted as additional context.

Use `$$` to pull in information from another tool (most often git).

You can trigger completion suggestions of identifiers while writing instructions
with ctrl-space.

P.S. The `Copy All` button pulls all the context into your clipboard with editing
instructions for o1pro.
